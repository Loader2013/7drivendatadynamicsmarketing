<ol start="7">
<li>Limitations of liability</li>

<p>In no event will LeadEnforce , LeadEnforce’s affiliates, LeadEnforce’s licensors or channel partners be liable for special, incidental or consequential damages resulting from possession, access, use or malfunction of the LeadEnforce services, including but not limited to, damages to property, loss of goodwill, computer failure or malfunction and, to the extent permitted by law, damages for personal injuries, property damage, lost profits or punitive damages from any causes of action arising out of or related to this eula or the software of the site, whether arising in tort (including negligence), contract, strict liability or otherwise and whether or not LeadEnforce, LeadEnforce’s licensors or channel partners have been advised of the possibility of such damages. For purposes of this section 7, LeadEnforce’s licensors and channel partners are third-party beneficiaries to the limitations of liability specified herein and they may enforce this eula against you.</p>
<p>because some states/countries do not allow certain limitations of liability, this limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction. This limitation of liability shall not be applicable solely to the extent that any specific provision of this limitation of liability is prohibited by any federal, state, or municipal law, which cannot be pre-empted. This eula gives you specific legal rights, and you may have other rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.</p>
<p>in no event shall LeadEnforce’s, LeadEnforce’s affiliates’, LeadEnforce’s licensors’ or channel partners’ liability for all damages (except as required by applicable law) exceed the actual price paid by you for use of the LeadEnforce services or five euros (eur 5), whichever less.</p>
